# Chatbot

This repository provides a hands-on practice guide for building a generative AI chatbot using OpenAI's ChatGPT API, LangChain, and Streamlit. The implementation is inspired by [this Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/generative-ai-for-beginners-b/learn/lecture/40913802#overview).

## Overview
The chatbot is designed to connect with personal documents and enable a Q&A capability, allowing users to extract information from uploaded PDFs.

## Installation
Before running the chatbot, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. Open a terminal and execute the following command:

```
pip install streamlit pypdf2 langchain faiss-cpu
```
Be aware that you might need to install langchain_community as well.

To run the code, use this in the terminal:

```
streamlit run "your_python_file.py"
```
